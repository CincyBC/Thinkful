1) Regression (Continuous)
2) Classification (Categorical: Colors)
3) Either could be used, depending on what you want. 
4) Classification (Categorial: Yes/No)
5) Either could be used depending on what you want. I'd use regression for an average.
6) Either could be used since there are a limited number of days and you are either sick or not.
7) It depends on how effectiveness is measured. Is it measured as a continuous number or yes/no based on certain conditions?
