1) You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
A: This is a case of contextual bias because February is snow season and May is beach season (in the northern hemisphere), so bathing suits are more on people's minds in May than in February.

2) You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
A: This is a Selection Bias. If it is a clinic to treat anxiety, it is not representative of the general population since they are seeking treatment for it.

3) You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
A: This may also be contextual bias. Perhaps this time of year generates more traffic than other times of the year. Also, this is just a billboard serving a single market. Is the web traffic coming from that specific area or elsewhere?

4) You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
A: Launching a loyalty program won't automatically change customers' habits in a single week. There needs to be a longer scale for the study to see how it affects growth. Also, other things such as advertizing the loyalty program, etc. need to be taken into consideration.
