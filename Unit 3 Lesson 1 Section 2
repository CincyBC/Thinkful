Using KNN to predict if people will pay their bills using the following features: Groceries, dining out, utilities, entertainment
To use KNN, with a Y variable as classification 'will pay' = 1 and 'won't pay' = 2, you'll be looking at the best combination of features to fit your model to for prediction. With the features groceries, dining out, utilities, entertainment, there might be some correlation between them, perhaps inverse with people who spend more on groceries spending less on dining out and vice versa. You might also see a correlation between entertainment and dining out with people who go out for fun (entertainment) may not be home in time to cook their groceries and therefore just dine out. Likewise, people who are home more often and are cooking, will also have higher utility bills because they'll be using their lights/Air conditioners/heaters/gas burners more often than those who are going out. 
It would be good to do a heatmap to look at these relationships. Since we have a common unit of measurement (dollars), there isn't a need to normalize the data. It may be interesting to combine data that have stronger correlations (as noted above) and use that info to predict. 
Another way to combine the data for prediction would to do PCA with the data to come up with independent variables that utilize the variance in each feature to make a prediction.
It's difficult to say which technique (down to how many K you use for your prediction) without data and playing around to see if you can create a model that is not overfitting the training data.
