      "I bought this from a local Army-Navy store to take on a canoeing/camping trip in Arkansas.  I read the reviews on Amazon, but bought it at the store cause it was a couple bucks cheaper.  The main reason I bought this set is because it's stainless, not aluminum.  Several of my camping buddies used aluminum and had a hard time cleaning it, especially cooking over open flames.  This set is also compact, and includes a cup with measurements so you know how much water to add to hot cocoa, oatmeal, etc.  Folds up nice, and fits in my pack.  There's enough room to put my utensils in it as well, so it's all together.  Lightweight, but also durable.  Some other sets have really weak handles, but this one is pretty strong.  The only thing I wish would be better is that when it's put up it would fit tighter and not bang around as much.  I didn't hike with it, so it wasn't that big of an issue.  All in all, a really nice set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.606576\n",

      "These high end Taiwan manufactured knives spyderco has been producing have been a real homerun for knife owners/collectors. Brad Southard evidently knows a lot about what goes into good knife design and Taiwan knows what they are doing when it comes to producing.The Design-The ergonomics are phenomenal on the handle. The curved handle sits very naturally in hand and the cut out where the index finger sits locks it in. The g-10 is aggressive.-The ball bearing pivot is smooth as hell-Flipper is very comfortable and fits your finger just right. The surface is angled just right to support the proper push to open the blade.-The Frame lock does not stick to the blade whatsoever. Is very easy to actuate because of the cutout in the handle. There is also a lock stop cleverly made of g-10. The face where the lock meets the blade has some kind of treatment to it where it appears slightly brown. I assume this is to reduce wear.-The finishing on the pocket clip matches the blade perfectly-Jimping on the blade and on the handle. Not very sharp, fairly smooth jimping.The Specs-Very long blade for the handle size which is rare in spyderco knives. 3.5&#34; cutting edge. 4.5&#34; handle-Thick blade stock(4mm), yet thin at cutting edge, about .63mm compared to my paramilitary at about .7mm-cts-204p blade steel. Do the research, but very comparable to m390, meaning very high end.-very light at 4oz weight-Titanium scales and g-10    0.597549\n",
      "I never had a brass cleaner before but decided to get this one due to the price and the complete kit in a box.  Didn't take long before I was cleaned some 45 brass for reloading. The brass came out quite nice and shiny just makes it easier to reload with clean brass. I did however have about a box of 45 brass that had been corroding in the elements for quite some time and it was almost black. I tried using the tumbler on the brass but it really didn't clean the brass due to the heavy corrosion.  Instead, I treated the heavy corrosive brass to a treatment of vinegar, hot water, dish soap and salt. This got most of the corrosion off the brass and then it polished up quite nicely in the tumbler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.595300\n",
      "It's extremely small so you won't be able to use this in many situations.  It's like fighting with a small box-cutter.  The handle is hard to hold but if you have small hands its doable.  The sheath is tight and keeps the blade from falling out.  I use this more as a utility knife and it keeps its edge pretty well.  As a self defense weapon, it truly is a last ditch choice because it is difficult to wield in your closed fist.  Its not easy to keep this blade steady and can be twisted out of your hand as you use it.  You don't have much to hold onto so any contact from most angles might cause you to lose the blade.  The hole in the handle isn't big enough for most fingers to slip in there.  The most feasible way of using this as a defense tool is to have the thumb brace the outer top part of the handle while your index and middle finger does its best to hold it within your closed fist.  You might be better off with wrapping your belt around your fist than to use this as a defense tool.  It's also not balanced for throwing purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.590650\n",

I've worn three different pairs of Oakley Polarized lenses and this is an outstanding pair of sunglasses. They provide good coverage around my eyebrows and can be pulled up snug to the face for maximum coverage, but also pulled out just a bit and have no contact with eyebrows etc... which is nice also. Would certainly consider buying again. They do make polarized lenses on the company home website I think. Cleaning the inside is a little challenging because of the no-fog coating, definitely water it fully before cleaning, otherwise your rag will drag along the no-fog film and do nothing.    0.521234\n",

      "I'm a big fan of the trioxane bars, going back to when I was in the service. We would hoard these things like they were gold, because they were so reliable. Plus, it was always fun to mess with the new guys, by telling them it was a special purple cookie (we weren't savages, we stopped them before they actually ate one)...Stupid GI jokes aside, the trioxane bars are small purple chalky bars, roughly the size of those small candy bars kids get when trick-or-treating. When touched with a match, the bars will burn with enough heat to make coffee or cook the ramen noodles you have squirreled away in your rucksack (everyone needs a break from MREs). I've burned trioxanes in the snow, in the damp jungle, and after submerging them crossing rivers. The Army designed them to burn, and burn they will...Another added benefit, for those who are worried about being tactical, is that trioxane burns with very little flame, and no smoke. So if you are in the bottom of a foxhole, or just burn the bar in a scrape you made in the dirt with your boot heel, the trioxane will not give your position away...Finally, a quick word on trioxane. These bars will store for a long time; they are packaged in thick metal vaccum-sealed foil, which in turn are stored in cardboard boxes. I've burned issue trioxane bars that were close to a decade old, and they worked just fine. If they get crushed or cracked, just push the pieces into a little pile, and they will still work fine. If you will pardon a paranoid former Infantryman: you might want to keep your face away from the bars when you are cooking your food. I don't have the slightest idea what the chemical makeup 'trioxane' actually is, but I don't think you want to inhale it!    0.510435\n",

      "I needed a portable work surface that could be set up and broken down quickly. This is a lightweight and versatile product that was just what I was looking for. What is particularly useful is being able to assemble the two halves at different heights and adjust each leg independently for a level surface. Not necessarily ultra portable for carrying long distances on foot, but it is simple enough to cart it around in a vehicle or caddy and set it up when required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.497662\n",

      "I purchased this grip to avoid having a strap on my DSLR camera. This grip is useful, but only when you are done removing (from the inside) a tiny screw that sticks out of the grip's surface, next to the screw that attaches the grip to the camera. If you were to leave this tiny screw in place, it would damage the bottom of the camera.You first have to remove the rubber padding, then remove the tiny screw, then figure out how to re-attach (with glue) the padding back on the grip. I have no idea why that tiny screw is there, but you cannot use this grip with the offending screw in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.487562\n",
      "My father has a Smith and Wesson SD40VE, he had two things he didn't like about the gun, one was the trigger pull.  The second was he had trouble stripping down the gun for cleaning.  He just had trouble getting the slide pulled back just right and depressing the stock take down plate.  I got him this one for fathers day and it makes field stripping the gun much easier.  If you own a Smith and Wesson SD of Sigma, get this.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  The spring for the take down plate is only retained by the take down plate, if you down use something to depress the spring and hold it in place when you replace the plate, it will go shooting across the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.484836\n",
