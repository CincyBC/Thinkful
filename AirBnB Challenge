Using the Athens Listings Data
#1
SELECT
  *,
  MAX(Price) Price
FROM
  listings
(Answer: ID 4219518, We can get all of the information including location, host name, features of the place, how fast the host responds, weblinks to photos, etc)

#2
WITH neighborhoods AS (
    SELECT
        l.id,
        l.neighbourhood_cleansed,
        c.listing_id,
		c.available
    FROM listings l
    JOIN calendar c
        ON l.id = c.listing_id
    WHERE
        c.available != "t"
    GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT
	  neighborhoods.neighbourhood_cleansed,
	  COUNT(available) available
FROM
	  neighborhoods
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY available desc
(Answer: To find the most popular, I took the neighborhoods with the most occupied days (occupied days = f, not t) and came up with the below:
"ΕΜΠΟΡΙΚΟ ΤΡΙΓΩΝΟ-ΠΛΑΚΑ"	"648"
"ΜΟΥΣΕΙΟ-ΕΞΑΡΧΕΙΑ-ΝΕΑΠΟΛΗ"	"458"
"ΚΟΥΚΑΚΙ-ΜΑΚΡΥΓΙΑΝΝΗ"	"326"
)

#3
WITH prices AS (
	SELECT
		date,
		price
	FROM calendar
	WHERE price > 0
)

SELECT
	date,
	AVG(price)
FROM prices
GROUP BY 1

(I got rid of the NULLs by creating a table with no NULL values and then took the average price and grouped by dates. This for some reason gave me 0.0 for averages still though)

WITH prices AS (
	SELECT
		date,
		available
	FROM calendar
	WHERE available != "t"
)

SELECT
	date,
	COUNT(available)
FROM prices
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY available DESC 

(ANSWER: May 9th was the busiest day with 3894 occupied rooms. The dates around this date all were in the top 5.)
