The Problem
Which is the most effective Sith slogan?

The Potential Solution
Either it is “Give in to your anger” or “Together we can rule the galaxy.”

Method of Testing
Take random samples of the target population and split them evenly into two groups. Present the slogan to Group A and present the other slogan to Group B and see how many of the group convert to the dark side. Follow up with the sample in a three months to see if they are still with the dark side or if they are back from the dark side.
