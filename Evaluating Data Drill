Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?

Data Source: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?

Data Source: Armenian Pub Survey. Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?
ANSWER: This data is mostly students, so it is not representative of the population as a whole (unless you limit the population in the question). Also, there was a 16 yr old who listed himself as a CEO, so I don't know how reliable the data is.
