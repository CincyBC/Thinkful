#1 This study suffers from Observer bias since the test is administered by two different Sith Lords and their charisma or the fear they strike into the droids may have bolstered one over the other. Also, these are 50 captured droids which may have introduced a selection bias. They may want to try their slogans on a larger population of random people to see how effective it is and administer it with neutral administrators.
#2 It’s not clear how the numbers are calculated here. Jar Jar and Windu both go out and promote the Jedi to eight planets and then a survey is conducted, but no details are provided regarding the survey. Were Jar Jar and Windu conducting a survey? If so, there would be an observer bias. Were all opinions accurately recorded? Did Jar Jar and Windu influence the participants in the survey?
#3 This one suffers from observer bias up front because the company took the survey and not an independent third party. Workers may tell the company something different from what they really think. This one also has a contextual bias if one tries to compare them to each other since HR is only in 3 countries while IT is in 5. 
#4 This is a selection bias because the ones most likely to opt in for the data collection are probably the most serious in using it.
#5 There isn’t enough information on the samples to judge. Were the samples nearly identical? How large were the samples? Enough to conclude that it wasn’t by chance? Probably not. Also, the point of the project was to prevent cheating, but the analysis becomes about versions of the test instead of cheating rates. I would have just created the same test with 3 different orders of the same questions to prevent cheating. There was no need to create three versions of the same content.
